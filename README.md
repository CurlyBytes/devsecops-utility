<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


**Everything as Code**(EaC) - is a process in which is all *Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Continuous Deployment*(CICD) is converted to scripts and part in the *Software Development LifeCycle Process*(SLDC). And using this EaC it is reusable to **DevOps Engineering Cluster**.

Here's why:
* By abstracting the EaC, the Governance of the Security and standard workflow of the script is now implemente as Enterprise CICD Script
* Unifying the templated script it is easier to maintain, upgrade and refactor across the Integration Platform
* Implementing the SOLID Principle by utilizing the Azure DevOps Yaml template in the CICD Script

Of course, This emplate will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!
